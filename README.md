# Pet Grooming Website  

## 1. Project Overview  
This project is a website design for a **Pet Grooming Business**. The goal is to create a warm, user-friendly, and professional platform where pet owners can easily explore grooming services, connect with the business, and book appointments online.  

I chose the pet grooming theme because I understand the importance of regular grooming for pets' health and comfort. As a pet owner myself, I have seen firsthand how grooming helps maintain hygiene, reduces stress, and improves overall well-being. This project combines my passion for design with personal experiences to create a meaningful, functional site.
